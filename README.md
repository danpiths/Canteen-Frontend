# Canteenwala Frontend

Canteenwala tries to help streamline the process of ordering food from our college’s canteen. 

There’s usually a lot of rush during the break periods and ordering food can be a hassle. 

Canteenwala provides an online experience for ordering food, viewing the menu (also viewing if the item is in stock or not) and for viewing if your food is ready yet, which can help reduce the efforts in ordering food. All your food ordering history can also be seen in the app.

Canteenwala also provides an admin login for updating items on the menu and their prices and availability, while also for viewing orders and marking them as complete so that the students may come and pick it up.

> Payments are not setup yet, so feel free to just press the Pay With UPI button, your order will be placed immediately and for free ;)
